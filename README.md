# heatmon

A simple Python program to turn my home heating system into Prometheus metrics.

I have a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W wired up to 6 DS18B20 thermometers, with these attached to hydronic heat zones, I can now monitor my stressfully unpredictable heating system.

See [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing/hardware) for more information on how to do the wiring.
